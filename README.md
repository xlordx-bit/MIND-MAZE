# MindBinder Game Code Overview

Here's a description of the app.py file structure and functionality:

## Core Components

1. **Class Structure**:
```python
class MindBinderGame:
    # Main game logic handler
```

2. **Key Methods**:
- `load_knowledge_base()`: Loads game data from JSON file
- `generate_question()`: Creates questions based on properties
- `update_probabilities()`: Updates confidence scores
- `make_guess()`: Determines final guess
- `learn_new_item()`: Adds new items to knowledge base

## Features

- **Knowledge Base**:
  - JSON-based storage
  - Default cat example with 8 properties
  - Expandable property system

- **Learning System**:
  - Dynamic property tracking
  - Confidence score calculations
  - Persistent storage

- **Flask Routes**:
  - `/`: Main game interface
  - `/ask_question`: Handles question generation
  - `/submit_answer`: Processes user responses
  - `/learn_item`: Adds new items

## Technical Details
- Uses Flask framework
- JSON for data persistence
- Confidence-based guessing algorithm
- Property-based object identification

The code implements a 20-questions style game that learns from user interactions and improves its guessing ability over time.
